It doesn't work fully for now, waiting to be completed.

- This addon will contain a lot of things in Optics, such as lens, reflectors and many more advanced things.
  There won't be actual models in this addon so model constructors will be utilized(Planning to learn from Primitive's example). I haven't tested the addon in multiplayer.
